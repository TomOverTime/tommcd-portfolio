## What I do

- **GA4 migration & validation** - Clean event design, ecommerce, cross-platform QA.
- **Segment architecture** - Source → warehouse → BI with clear governance.
- **Dashboards & reporting** - BigQuery/Snowflake → Looker/other BI.
- **Experimentation QA** - 200+ A/B tests shipped; trustworthy reads.

_Goal: analytics that are reliable, fast, and decision-ready._
